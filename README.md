# Roadmap
- [ ] Automatically remove invalid workshop maps (currently only sends notification)
- [ ] !extend max extension value
- [ ] Add vote percentage required for winning map (e.g. must receive 25% of the vote)
- [ ] Add vote runnoff (e.g. 2nd stage of voting between 2 maps if minimum vote percentage not achieved for a map)
- [ ] Add !revote to allow players to change their vote
- [ ] Add live vote count to ScreenMenu and allow menu to optionally stay open.
